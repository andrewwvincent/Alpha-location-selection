# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Files Included
- ✅ `index.html` - Main application (renamed from us_national_map.html)
- ✅ `us_schools_data.js` - All 14,448 US schools (~2MB)
- ✅ `census_tracts/MA.geojson` - Massachusetts census tracts (~6MB)
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

### File Sizes (GitHub Pages Limits)
- **Repository limit**: 1GB total ✅
- **File size limit**: 100MB per file ✅
- **Current total**: ~8MB (well within limits)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Create new repository on GitHub
# Name suggestion: "school-location-analysis" or "us-school-mapper"
```

### 2. Upload Files
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment of US School Location Analysis Tool"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Pages** section
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose **main** branch
5. Select **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### 4. Access Your App
- URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`
- Usually takes 5-10 minutes to deploy initially

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### CORS Headers
- GitHub Pages automatically serves files with proper CORS headers
- No additional configuration needed for GeoJSON loading

### File Paths
- All paths are relative (no localhost references)
- Census tract files load from `census_tracts/` directory
- School data loads from root directory

### Performance Considerations
- Initial load: ~2MB (school data)
- Census tracts load on-demand per state
- Caching enabled for repeated visits

## 📊 Adding More States

To add census tract data for additional states:

1. **Generate GeoJSON files** using `organize_census_tracts.py`
2. **Copy to census_tracts/** directory
3. **Check file sizes** (keep under 25MB per file for optimal performance)
4. **Commit and push** to update live site

Example:
```bash
# Add California census tracts
cp census_tracts/CA.geojson "Final App/census_tracts/"
git add "census_tracts/CA.geojson"
git commit -m "Add California census tract data"
git push
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App doesn't load:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all files uploaded correctly
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled

**Census tracts don't load:**
- Check file exists in census_tracts/ directory
- Verify file size under 25MB
- Check browser network tab for 404 errors

**Sliders not working:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Verify index.html uploaded correctly

### Performance Tips

**For large deployments:**
- Keep individual GeoJSON files under 10MB
- Consider splitting large states into regions
- Use browser caching headers (automatic on GitHub Pages)

**For faster loading:**
- Compress GeoJSON files if needed
- Consider CDN for very large datasets
- Implement progressive loading for many states

## 📈 Analytics & Monitoring

### GitHub Pages Analytics
- View traffic in repository **Insights** → **Traffic**
- Monitor popular pages and referrers
- Track visitor counts and page views

### Performance Monitoring
- Use browser DevTools to monitor load times
- Check Core Web Vitals for user experience
- Monitor file sizes as you add more states

## 🔄 Updates & Maintenance

### Updating the App
1. Make changes locally
2. Test thoroughly
3. Commit and push to main branch
4. GitHub Pages auto-deploys (5-10 minutes)

### Data Updates
- School data: Replace `us_schools_data.js`
- Census tracts: Add/update files in `census_tracts/`
- Always test locally before deploying

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ App loads at GitHub Pages URL
- ✅ All 14,448 schools visible on map
- ✅ Massachusetts census tracts load correctly
- ✅ All sliders work with real-time updates
- ✅ Metro navigation functions properly
- ✅ Tract clicking shows detailed analysis
